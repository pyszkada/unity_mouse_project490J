#Organizational Guidelines:
## Assets Folder:
Place files in their appropriatly named folders (Materials, Characters, Timelines, Scripts, Etc.).
## Sequence Organization and Management:
The Set is its own separate Scene. 
Every Sequence (per person) is placed in its own scene. Overlay these scenes over the scene set.

To update/Add a sequence:
	- Add the scene to the build (File->Build Settings...->Add Open Scenes) 
	- Go to the SceneManager in the Set
	- Create a new shot in sequence (for now just add a new element to the array)
	- fill out the scene name and the scene length.

for all intensive purposes DO NOT TOUCH THE SET, unless:
	- updating lighting/post-processing
	- updating SceneManager


# How to watch they flythrough: 

1. Make sure the only open scene is the Set.
2. hit the play button at the center.
3. enjoy
